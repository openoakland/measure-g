It supports a few key Measure G ballot language initiatives. However, the Measure G Committee recommended in 2015-16 that OUSD reduce the amount of Measure G funds assigned to the Basic School Support category so that the designation of Measure G funds better aligned with the ballot language. The Committee and OUSD staff will be working to better designate these funds in the 2016-17 school year.</div>
